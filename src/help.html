      <h3>Europe's newest lottery</h3>
      <p>The decision to launch the latest pan-European lottery was made in Amsterdam, with nine national lottery companies cooperating from the outset (compared to just three for the EuroMillions in 2004!). Seven more joined until February 2013. The cooperating countries have pooled together for a maximum payout of 90 million Euros, and a respectable 10 million Euro minimum.</p>
      <p>The EuroJackpot is the first major competitor to the EuroMillions lottery, which was launched way back in 2004. EuroMillions is still significantly larger than the EuroJackpot, with its maximum prize of 190 million Euros. However, it is worth noting that the odds of winning the EuroJackpot are better than winning the EuroMillions; EuroMillions odds are worse than the EuroJackpot (1 in 95 million for the EuroJackpot, versus 1 in 117 million).</p>
